# Postman Tools

This repository is a collection of helpful tools that extend the functionality of Postman.

- `ResponsesToFile`: Add a script to your Postman requests / collections and save `responses` to JSON locally
- `ResponsesDiff`: Compare folders of saved `responses` with an interactive, fuzzy-logic diff tool. Useful to identify synchronization issues between servers.
